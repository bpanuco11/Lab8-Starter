## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers
Graceful degradation ensures that a website remains functional to some extends in the absence of essential tools that keep the website working. With Service workers we allow our website to function in the case where our wifi network crashes by relying on the website's cache; basically when the user goes offline. By allowing our website to work without an essential component, in this case the wifi network, we are essentially using the idea of graceful degradation since we make it possible for our website to keep functioning in the case that something goes wrong.
